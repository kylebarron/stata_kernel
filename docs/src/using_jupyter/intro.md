# Introduction to Jupyter

There are many different ways to use Jupyter. I'll briefly explain several ways of using Jupyter and provide links to more documentation. The information in this section is common to all languages Jupyter supports. [Using the Stata Kernel](../using_stata_kernel/magics.md) has information specific to using Stata with Jupyter.

If you're unsure which to use, choose [JupyterLab](lab.md).

- [JupyterLab](lab.md): This is an interactive web-based editor that improves upon the classic Notebook by making it easy to work with several files at the same time in the same window. Users familiar with RStudio may like this.
- [Hydrogen for Atom](atom.md): This is a plugin for the Atom text editor that displays results in line with your code. It's my personal favorite.
- [Jupyter Notebook](notebook.md): This is the classic interactive web-based editor.
- [Nteract](nteract.md): This is a desktop application to work with Jupyter Notebook files. Some may prefer it to the classic web interface of Jupyter Notebooks.
- [Jupyter Console](console.md): This is an enhanced REPL that lives in the console.
- [Jupyter QtConsole](qtconsole.md): An enhanced console that additionally supports graphs and other rich-text displays.
- [Working remotely](remote.md): Any of these tools can be used to edit code on your local computer and have the code run on a remote Unix/Linux server.
