STATA_KERNEL


stata_kernel is a Jupyter kernel for Stata. It works on Windows, macOS,
and Linux.


What is Jupyter?

Jupyter is an open-source ecosystem for interactive data science.
Originally developed around the Python programming language, Jupyter has
grown to interface with dozens of programming languages.

stata_kernel is the bridge that interactively connects Stata to all the
elements in the ecosystem.

-   The JUPYTER NOTEBOOK is a web-based interactive editor that allows
    for interweaving of code, text, and results.

    -   Splice models in LaTeX math mode with the code that implements
        them and the graphs depicting their output.
    -   Jupyter Notebooks can be exported as PDFs or HTML, and are as
        good for teaching new students as they are for displaying
        research results.
    -   Use Stata in the same document with R, Python, or Julia code.

-   HYDROGEN is a package for the Atom text editor that connects with
    Jupyter kernels to display results interactively in your text
    editor.
-   The JUPYTER CONSOLE is an enhanced interactive console. Its features
    include enhanced autocompletion, better searching of history, syntax
    highlighting, among others. The similar QtConsole even allows
    displaying plots within the terminal.
-   Enhanced remote work. You can set up Jupyter to run computations
    remotely but to show results locally. Since the only data passing
    over the network are the text inputs and outputs from Stata,
    communcation happens much faster than loading xstata, especially on
    slower networks. Being able to use Jupyter Notebook or Hydrogen
    vastly enhances productivity compared to working with the Stata
    console through a remote terminal.
