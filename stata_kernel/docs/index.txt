STATA_KERNEL


stata_kernel is a Jupyter kernel for Stata. It works on Windows, macOS,
and Linux.


What is Jupyter?

Jupyter is an open-source ecosystem for interactive data science.
Originally developed around the Python programming language, Jupyter has
grown to interface with dozens of programming languages.

stata_kernel is the bridge that interactively connects Stata to all the
elements in the ecosystem.

-   The JUPYTER NOTEBOOK is a web-based interactive editor that allows
    for interweaving of code, text, and results.

    -   Splice models in LaTeX math mode with the code that implements
        them and the graphs depicting their output.
    -   Jupyter Notebooks can be exported as PDFs or HTML, and are as
        good for teaching new students as they are for displaying
        research results.
    -   Use Stata in the same document with R, Python, or Julia code.

-   The JUPYTER CONSOLE is an enhanced interactive console. Its features
    include enhanced autocompletion, better searching of history, syntax
    highlighting, among others.
-   HYDROGEN is a package for the Atom text editor that connects with
    Jupyter kernels to display results interactively in your text
    editor.
-   Enhanced remote work. You can set up Jupyter to run computations
    remotely but to show results locally, vastly enhancing productivity
    compared to working with the Stata console through a command line.
